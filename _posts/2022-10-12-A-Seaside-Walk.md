Dear Friend:

<br>

This very first blog of my website portrays a seaside walk on the afternoon of October 12th. The perfect weather tempted me to quit doing my work and take a walk along the Belcher Bay. It did not take a long time for me to realize that I had made a right decision.



Among all the ships harboring in the Belcher Bay, the superyacht *[Nord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_(yacht))* was no doubt the most eye-catching one. Owned by the Russian oligarch Alexey Mordashov, *Nord* travelled to Hong Kong probably to flee from seizure by Western authorities.

But perhaps only fellow international law students would have thought of the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war when witnessing a Russian vessel. For citizens at Kennedy Town Waterfront, it is far more important to enjoy the zephyr blowing from the sea and the waves glistening under the sunset.

<center>A pleasant afternoon for everyone, isn't it?</center>

<br>

Just as Kuafu (or maybe Icarus), I kept walking towards the west to capture the sun. It sank faster than I thought, igniting the entire sky.

<br>

Fifteen minutes later, my joyful journey ended at the Sai Wan Swimming Shed. Hidden in the woods, this place was a perfect spot to take a closer look at the beautiful sea, and to conclude my Wednesday outing.

<center>You are no match for the <i>Nord</i>, with all due respect.</center>

<br>

I will keep documenting my venture here at Hong Kong. Whoever you are, I wish you like this city as much as I do.

<br>

Yours Sincerely,

the Howling Universe
